### Hi there 👋
Digital Explorer (Engineer/Innovator/Adventurer)

Northeastern University - Student; Former Intern at Stealth Startup
🚀 I'm a software engineer diving deep into my Computer Science master’s degree at Northeastern, set to graduate in May 2025.
💼 Actively seeking a Spring 2024 SDE Internship and eyeing exciting New Grad opportunities for 2024.
💼 Currently sharpening my teaching skills as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Northeastern.
🔭 Engrossed in projects involving Cloud Technology, Distributed Systems, and Advanced Web Development.
📚 On a learning spree with AWS Certifications and delving into the complexities of Recommendation Systems.
⚡ Fun fact: I once engineered a Raspberry Pi-based autonomous car for a tech fest — it dodged obstacles like a pro! Thrill-seeker by nature, whether coding at a hackathon or scaling the nearest mountain peak!
