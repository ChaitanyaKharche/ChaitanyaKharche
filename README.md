### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Digital Explorer (Engineer/Innovator/Adventurer)

Northeastern University - Student; Former Intern at Stealth Startup <br>
ðŸš€ I'm a software engineer diving deep into my Computer Science masterâ€™s degree at Northeastern, set to graduate in May 2025.<br>
ðŸ’¼ Actively seeking a Spring 2024 SDE Internship and eyeing exciting New Grad opportunities for 2024.<br>
ðŸ’¼ Currently sharpening my teaching skills as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Northeastern.<br>
ðŸ”­ Engrossed in projects involving Cloud Technology, Distributed Systems, and Advanced Web Development.<br>
ðŸ“š On a learning spree with AWS Certifications and delving into the complexities of Recommendation Systems.<br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I once engineered a Raspberry Pi-based autonomous car for a tech fest â€” it dodged obstacles like a pro! Thrill-seeker by nature, whether coding at a hackathon or scaling the nearest mountain peak!<br>
