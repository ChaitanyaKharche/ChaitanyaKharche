Northeastern University - Student; Former Intern at Stealth Startup
ğŸš€ I'm a software engineer diving deep into my Computer Science masterâ€™s degree at Northeastern, set to graduate in May 2025.
ğŸ’¼ Actively seeking a Spring 2024 SDE Internship and eyeing exciting New Grad opportunities for 2024.
ğŸ’¼ Currently sharpening my teaching skills as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Northeastern.
ğŸ”­ Engrossed in projects involving Cloud Technology, Distributed Systems, and Advanced Web Development.
ğŸ“š On a learning spree with AWS Certifications and delving into the complexities of Recommendation Systems.
âš¡ Fun fact: I once engineered a Raspberry Pi-based autonomous car for a tech fest â€” it dodged obstacles like a pro! Thrill-seeker by nature, whether coding at a hackathon or scaling the nearest mountain peak!
