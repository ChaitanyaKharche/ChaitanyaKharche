### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Digital Explorer (Engineer/Innovator/Adventurer)

<b>Northeastern University</b> - Student; Coder <br>

ðŸš€ I'm a <b>software engineer</b> diving deep into my Computer Science masterâ€™s degree at Northeastern, set to graduate in May 2025.<br>

ðŸ’¼ Actively seeking a <b>Summer/Fall 2024 SDE Internship/Co-op</b> and eyeing exciting New Grad opportunities for 2025.<br>

ðŸ’¼ Currently sharpening my teaching skills as a <b>Graduate Teaching Assistant</b> at Northeastern.<br>

ðŸ”­ Engrossed in projects involving Cloud Technology, and Mobile & Web Development and Scalable Applications.<br>

ðŸ“š On a learning spree with AWS Certifications and delving into the complexities of combining AI with Software in non-traditional ways.<br>

âš¡ Fun fact: I once engineered a Raspberry Pi-based autonomous car for a tech fest â€” it dodged obstacles like a pro! Thrill-seeker by nature, whether coding at a hackathon or scaling the nearest mountain peak!<br>
